Konfig is a developer tools company; we build API tooling based off the OpenAPI Specification and Postman Collection Format standards.

### The Problem
Onboarding customers for API-first companies is difficult because APIs are complicated and time-consuming to integrate.

### The Solution
We generate SDKs for APIs so developers can integrate any API while writing as few lines of code as possible.
